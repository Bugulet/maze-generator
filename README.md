# Maze generator in unity
Procedurally generates mazes both in pixel (2D) and 3D mode, just select whichever you want.

## Either download the project or try it out first:

## 2D mode (fast even at max width/height since its just a texture)

## 3D mode (slower since WebGPU is still not implemented yet on the web sadly, huge numbers at your own risk)
